# ND7 MIDI Device Build Status

## Current State
- Project is configured and partially building
- Main compilation errors have been fixed
- Build is failing due to memory constraints during C++ compilation

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Fixed Makefile webkit package name: `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` → `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`
2. ✅ Installed system dependencies successfully
3. ✅ Setup JUCE submodule successfully 
4. ✅ Downloaded and installed LibTorch to `/usr/local/libtorch`
5. ✅ CMake configuration completed successfully
6. ✅ Fixed missing JUCE includes in PluginProcessor.h: added `juce_audio_devices`
7. ✅ Updated CMakeLists.txt to link `juce::juce_audio_devices`
8. ✅ Fixed deprecated MIDI API usage in PluginProcessor.cpp
9. ✅ Fixed model data variable names in NeuralModelWrapper.cpp
10. ✅ Added missing torch/script.h include

## Fixed Code Issues

### PluginProcessor.h
- Added `#include <juce_audio_devices/juce_audio_devices.h>`

### CMakeLists.txt  
- Added `juce::juce_audio_devices` to target_link_libraries

### PluginProcessor.cpp
- Fixed deprecated `juce::MidiOutput::openDevice(i)` → `juce::MidiOutput::openDevice(devices[i].identifier)`

### NeuralModelWrapper.h
- Added `#include <torch/script.h>`

### NeuralModelWrapper.cpp
- Fixed model data variable names: `models_dx7_vae_model_pt` → `_home_vm_ndx7cpp_models_dx7_vae_model_pt`

## Current Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - Core library and standalone application built successfully  
✅ **SEGFAULT FIXED** - PyTorch model loading crash resolved with lazy loading
✅ **GUI CRASH FIXED** - Fixed JUCE constructor ordering issue by moving setSize() after component initialization
✅ **APPLICATION RUNNING** - Debug standalone version launches without crashing

## Resolved Issues
- Fixed memory exhaustion during compilation by removing embedded model
- Modified NeuralModelWrapper to load model from external file: `models/dx7_vae_model.pt`
- Successfully built release version of standalone application
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Implemented lazy loading in NeuralModelWrapper constructor to prevent PyTorch segfault
- Fixed debug build curl dependency by disabling JUCE networking features
- Added robust error handling with multiple exception types for model loading

## Latest Fix Applied
- **Root Cause**: Classic JUCE constructor ordering problem where `setSize()` was called before GUI components were initialized
- **Solution**: Moved `setSize(600, 400)` to the end of constructor after all components are created and added
- **Result**: Application now launches successfully without crashing

## Fixed Code Issues (Latest)

### PluginEditor.cpp Constructor Fix
- Moved `setSize()` call from beginning to end of constructor
- Ensured all GUI components (titleLabel, sliders, buttons) are created before layout occurs
- Prevents premature `resized()` call that was causing null pointer dereference

## Environment Notes
- Desktop session uses: `DISPLAY=:0`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0`, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`
- Firefox launches successfully with proper environment variables
- Application needs to be run from desktop terminal or with proper display authorization
